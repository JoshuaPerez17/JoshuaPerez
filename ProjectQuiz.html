<!-- Some of the features i used for this project included the radio input type. This input creates multiple buttons that the user can choose,
much like a multiple choice test. Each of the radio buttons contain a name which is based on what question it is. For the first question, I 
used an input form that allows keyboard input. In the javascript file, I included the correct word that qualifies as the right answer. This 
file also contains a radio that includes an image next to it. This was the most difficult part of the project since I had to figure out 
how to program it to be functional.
